**Title: Scattering matrices for noncommutative instantons**

Abstract:
The scattering transform is a powerful tool that identifies moduli spaces of monopoles on $\R^3$ with generalized slices in the affine Grassmannian of the monopole gauge group. Upon quantization, monopole scattering matrices become R-matrices for shifted Yangians based on finite-dimensional Lie algebras. In this talk we will explain how this construction can be generalized to moduli spaces of noncommutative instantons on R^4 and R^3 x S^1; the corresponding scattering matrices are semiclassical limits of R-matrices of shifted affine Yangians (in type A). Variations on the theme lead to deformations of the B-model of topological string theory on backgrounds of the form uv + P(z, w) = 0, that live over the moduli space of noncommutative instantons (the noncommutativity parameter is identified with the topological string coupling). Based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07949

**Title: Toward geometric R-matrix formalism for Coulomb branch actions**

Abstract:
Instanton scattering matrices constructed in the previous talk give evidence for the existence of an R-matrix (re)construction of quantized Coulomb branch algebras of 3d N=4 quiver gauge theories using the (shifted) Yangian associated to the quiver. In this talk I will report on progress in putting this in a more standard context for geometric construction of Yangian actions, using critical cohomology of moduli spaces of quasimaps to Nakajima quiver varieties. This is joint work in progress with Tommaso Botta.
