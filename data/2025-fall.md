**Title:** Critical stable envelopes

Video:


Abstract:
This will be a report on a joint project with Yalong Cao, Yehao Zhou, and Zijun Zhou, in which we systematically explore the world of stable envelopes in critical cohomology and critical K-theory. We will compare and contrast old stable envelope to the more general critical stable envelopes, with an emphasis on the contrasting features.

**Title:** Towards Constructing G Monopoles

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqiG3Ik6wy8


Abstract:
Nahm’s construction of magnetic monopoles produced all monopoles with gauge (structure) group G=U(n). It was generalized by Hurtubise and Murray to SO and Sp monopoles. For any compact Lie group G, in principle, Nahm’s construction can be used to obtain monopoles in any given unitary representation of G. For example, for G=E8, the smallest such representation has dimension 248, making this construction highly impractical, if at all tractable. We explore an alternative encoding of monopole data, based of recent work of Bielawski and Foscolo, motivating it from the D-brane configuration in Kleinian surface of ADE type. The type of the surface corresponds to the monopole structure group G. While it seems to reproduce the monopole moduli space correctly, the actual monopole construction remains an open question. This talk is an attempt to reconstruct the monopole from the string theory analysis of the concrete brane configuration.

**Title:** A new approach to superstring

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8f3SOEn6NY


Abstract:
We show how starting with one-string space of states in BRST formalism one can construct a large class of physical quantities containing, in particular, scattering amplitudes for bosonic string and superstring. The same techniques work for heterotic string.

**Title:** Quasimaps to the Flag Variety and Tilting Modules in Category O

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1htRbd2DSA, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_IUTPY_efo


Abstract:
A quasimap from a curve to a GIT quotient is a map to the stack quotient that is generically stable. An open subset of quasimaps from P^1 to the flag variety, usually called Laumon space or handsaw quiver variety, is known to be closely related to the representation theory of gl_n. In particular, one can construct an action of gl_n on the cohomology of Laumon spaces via geometric correspondences. In this talk, I will explain how to construct an action of gl_n on the cohomology of the full moduli space of quasimaps and explore its relation to tilting modules in Category O.

**Title:** Inverse Hamiltonian reduction for W-algebras in type A

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dalIVctiDKU


Abstract:
Inverse Hamiltonian reduction refers to a series of conjectural relations between W-algebras corresponding to distinct nilpotent orbits in a Lie algebra. I will outline a proof of this conjecture in type A that relies on novel geometric methods. Along the way, we shall encounter the localization of vertex algebras and, time permitting, speak briefly on the deformation theory thereof. To build intuition, I shall focus on the finite type analogue of this story, where such techniques are more commonplace. This talk is based on joint work with Dylan Butson.

**Title:** Fukaya Category approach to Categorification of Quantum Group (I)

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ARD2oyR1U


Abstract:
This is a series of two lectures on categorifying quantum group U_q(g) using Fukaya categories proposed by Mina Aganagic. In the first lecture, we will give an introduction to the theory, focusing on the geometric setup, basic calculations and connection to representation theory; in the second lecture we will discuss the TQFT structures underlying our theory, proposing the definition of Hopf(ish) category as a categorication of Kapranov-Schechtman’s factorizable perverse sheaf and primitive bialgebra. This is a joint work with Mina Aganagic, Vivek Shende, Elise LePage.

**Title:** (Khovanov) skein lasagna modules of 4-manifolds

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCWQ5SbzrB0


Abstract:
For any well-behaved link homology theory for links in the 3-sphere, Morrison–Walker–Wedrich defined an invariant for smooth 4-manifolds called skein lasagna modules, which can be viewed as an upgrade of the input link homology theory. We review the definition and investigate some formal properties of the invariant. We also introduce a few variations of the invariant. In the case where the input link homology theory is Khovanov homology, the resulting skein lasagna modules are strong enough to detect exotic 4-manifolds, i.e. smooth 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic. This is a sequence of two expository talks, partly based on joint work with I. Sullivan, P. Wedrich, M. Walker, M. Willis, and M. Zhang.

**Title:** (Khovanov) skein lasagna modules of 4-manifolds II

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39vFLXRH2-M


Abstract:
Continuation of the previous talk about skein lasagna modules. We review some features of the Khovanov homology and its Lee deformation. We examine the resulting skein lasagna modules with these two theories as inputs, extract a lasagna version of Rasmussen’s s-invariant, and state some formal properties. We then show that Khovanov/Lee skein lasagna modules and lasagna s-invariants can distinguish exotic pairs of 4-manifolds, namely smooth 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic. Background on smooth 4-manifolds will be explained when necessary. This is joint work with Mike Willis.

**Title:** Skein lasagna modules and Khovanov homology for S^1 × S^2

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZhACIzTFxk


Abstract:
Skein lasagna modules are invariants of smooth 4-dimensional manifolds capable of detecting exotic phenomena. Wall-type stabilization problems ask about the behavior of exotic phenomena under various topological operations. In this talk, we will describe the invariants we use and the necessary properties. We describe, with Wall-type external stabilization problems as motivation, a method for computing the Khovanov skein lasagna module of S^2 × S^2. Rozansky-Willis homology, an invariant of links in connect-sums of S^1 × S^2, makes an appearance in this computational technique, and we establish a relationship between the skein lasagna module of a family of 4-manifolds and these invariants. This computational method shows that Khovanov skein lasagna modules over Q are annihilated by external stabilizations, and has proven useful for establishing the functoriality of Rozansky-Willis homology.

**Title:** Coulomb branches and functoriality in the geometric Langlands program

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuJ2KrhwUAM


Abstract:
In 2017, Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima gave a precise definition of the Coulomb branch of a 3d N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory of cotangent type associated to a complex reductive group G and a finite dimensional complex representation N. In our first part of this talk, we will recall the definition and basic properties of such Coulomb branches, as well as give some motivation for its study. We will then discuss an alternate definition of the Coulomb branch for (G, N) due to Teleman assuming that (G, N) satisfies a certain condition that we call gluable. In the second part of this talk, we will discuss functoriality of these Coulomb branches: in other words, we will discuss how, given a map of reductive groups H → G, one can recover the Coulomb branch associated to the pair (H, N) from the pair (G, N), assuming our map is gluable. We will also discuss the connections to functoriality in the geometric Langlands program and explain our conjecture, recently proved by Victor Ginzburg, that the Coulomb branch of (G, N) determines the S-dual (in the sense of, say, Ben-Zvi–Sakellaridis–Venkatesh) of the pair (G, N). This is joint with Ben Webster.
