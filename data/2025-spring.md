**Title:** A braided monoidal (∞,2)-category from link homology

Video:


Abstract:
An early highlight of quantum topology was the observation that the Jones polynomial — and many other knot and link invariants — arise from braided monoidal categories of quantum group representations. In hindsight, this can be understood as underlying reason for the existence  of associated topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in 3 and 4 dimensions. Not much later, Khovanov discovered a link homology theory that categorifies the Jones polynomial. It associates graded chain complexes to links, from which the Jones polynomials can be recovered. It was therefore speculated that Khovanov homology and its variants may themselves be expressible in terms of certain braided monoidal 2-categories and that there should exist associated TQFTs in 4 and 5 dimensions that may be sensitive to smooth structure. A major challenge in fully realizing this dream is the problem of coherence: Link homology theories live in the world of homological algebra, where constructing a braided monoidal structure in principle requires an infinite amount of higher and higher homological coherence data. In this talk, I will sketch a proposed solution to this problem, joint with Leon Liu, Aaron Mazel-Gee, David Reutter, and Catharina Stroppel, and explain how we use the language of infinity-categories to build an E2-monoidal (∞,2)-category which categorifies the Hecke braided monoidal category underlying the HOMFLYPT link polynomial.

**Title:** Schur quantization

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4fJTsySpY8


Abstract:
Schur quantization refers to a particular type of representation of the quantized algebras of functions on Coulomb branches of vacua of N=2, d=4 supersymmetric quantum field theories, providing a quantum theoretical interpretation of the Schur indices. My talk will describe how the Schur quantization encodes key aspects of the low energy physics of the underlying theory, and how it provides a new quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory related to the analytic Langlands correspondence. The talk is based on joint work with D. Gaiotto, and work in progress with F. Ambrosino and D. Gaiotto.

**Title:** Symplectic annular Khovanov homology and fixed point localisation

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2R7vWenmw8&pp=2AbfHA%3D%3D


Abstract:
Khovanov homology is a powerful link invariant which has numerous applications. It is powerful not only because it is a strong invariant, but also it is functorial and has many relations with other invariants. In 2018, Stoffregen-Zhang realized that there is a spectral sequence from the Khovanov homology of a periodic link to the annular Khovanov homology of its quotient, which was later used by Baldwin-Hu-Sivek to show that Khovanov homology detects the (2,5) torus knot. In 2022, Lipshitz-Sarkar extends Stoffregen-Zhang’s result to strongly invertible knot and the infinity page of the spectral sequence is, mysteriously, the cone of the annular Khovanov homology of the axis moving map between the two resolutions of the quotient. In this talk, we will explain the symplectic analogues of these spectral sequences and why they are easy consequences of fixed point localisation theorem of Lagrangian Floer theory. This is a joint work with Hendricks and Raghunath.

**Title:** Quasimaps to flag varieties: again

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0jQt6HmK7w, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmDiTvqnJd4&pp=2AadAw%3D%3D


Abstract:
Quasimaps to flag varieties have been studied from many, many angles using a wide variety of different techniques. I will discuss some known as well as few new features of these spaces in a way that may suggest generalizations to other targets.

**Title:** Perverse schobers from Lefschetz fibrations

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFH1k2cOoGQ&pp=2Aa2DA%3D%3D


Abstract:
Perverse schobers refer to perverse sheaves of (enhanced) triangulated categories, as introduced by Kapranov-Schechtman. Though their general theory remains conjectural, there exists a robust theory of perverse schobers on surfaces with boundary. In the talk, we will discuss how such perverse schobers naturally arise from cosheaves of Fukaya categories of Lefschetz fibrations constructed by Ganatra-Pardon-Shende. For instance, in the case of the disc, the Fukaya-Seidel category arises as the category of global sections of a perverse schober. We then discuss how the formalism of perverse schobers can facilitate many computations. A key point is that by using sheaves of categories, as opposed to cosheaves, one can construct objects and morphisms in the global category via the gluing of local data. Finally, we will also indicate examples of perverse schobers in higher dimensions arising from repeated Lefschetz fibrations (obtained in joint work with Dyckerhoff and Walde).

**Title:** Stable envelope for critical loci

Video:


Abstract:
In this talk we will introduce a generalization of Maulik-Okounkov’s stable envelopes to equivariant critical cohomology. In the case of a tripled quiver variety with standard cubic potential, this reduces to MO’s stable envelope for the Nakajima variety of the corresponding doubled quiver along the dimensional reduction. We define non-abelian stable envelopes for quivers with potentials following a similar construction of Aganagic-Okounkov, and use them to relate critical COHAs to the abelian stable envelopes. Explicit computations are given in three examples: 1) Verma modules and higher spin representations of Yangian of sl(2); 2) oscillator representations of shifted Yangian of sl(2); 3) fundamental representation of Yangian of sl(2|1). This talk is based on joint work in progress with Yalong Cao, Andrei Okounkov, and Zijun Zhou.

**Title:** The skein valued mirror of the topological vertex

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKn6ohHCrgU


Abstract:
We count holomorphic curves in complex 3-space with boundaries on three special Lagrangian solid tori. The count is valued in the HOMFLYPT skein module of the union of the tori. Using 1-parameter families of curves at infinity, we derive three skein valued operator equations which must annihilate the count, and which dequantize to a mirror of the geometry. We show algebraically that the resulting equations determine the count uniquely, and that the result agrees with the topological vertex from topological string theory.

**Title:** Quiver folding and cohomological Hall modules

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CxGXmA6VdI


Abstract:
The cohomological Hall algebra of a quiver can serve as model of an algebra of BPS states of a 4d N = 2 theory. We investigate modules for the CoHA which arise from (anti-)involutions of the underlying quiver, and find that the cohomology of moduli stacks of objects with classical type structure groups (e.g. for orthosymplectic quivers) gives a module which satisfies an interesting axiom (the twisted Yetter-Drinfeld condition). We also discuss examples with applications to moduli of classical type bundles on surfaces and the AGT correspondence.

**Title:** Deformed Mirror Symmetry for Punctured Surfaces

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG71WV6OvM4


Abstract:
Mirror symmetry aims at equivalences of Fukaya categories (A-side) and categories of coherent sheaves (B-side). Deformed mirror symmetry aims at matching deformations of A-side and B-side. In this talk, I explain how to do it in case of mirror symmetry for punctured surfaces. We start by constructing gentle algebras and matrix factorizations, which serve as A-side and B-side. Then we deform gentle algebras and show how to transfer the deformation to the B-side. (2023 PhD thesis, supervised by Raf Bocklandt)

**Title:** Deformations of cyclic quotient surface singularities via mirror symmetry

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPvdpBoI4vU


Abstract:
Let X_0 be a rational surface with a cyclic quotient singularity (1,a)/r. Kawamata constructed a remarkable vector bundle K_0 on X_0 such that the finite-dimensional algebra End(K_0), called the Kalck-Karmazyn algebra, “absorbs” the singularity of X_0 in a categorical sense. If we deform over an irreducible component of the versal deformation space of X_0 (as described by Kollár and Shepherd-Barron), the bundle K_0 also deforms to a vector bundle K. These results were established using abstract methods of birational geometry, making the explicit computation of the family of algebras challenging. We will utilise homological mirror symmetry to compute End(K) explicitly in the A-model. In the case of a Q-Gorenstein smoothing, this algebra End(K) is a matrix order deforming the Kalck-Karmazyn algebra, and “absorbs” the singularity of the corresponding terminal 3-fold singularity. Time permitting, I will also discuss a conjecture describing irreducible components of the deformation space of X_0 in terms of the finite-dimensional algebra End(K_0).

**Title:** Aganagic’s invariant is Khovanov homology

Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO-0BgvpM-o&pp=2AbIAdIHCQmHCgGHKiGM7w%3D%3D


Abstract:
In recent work, Aganagic proposed a categorification of quantum link invariants using Lagrangian Floer theory in multiplicative Coulomb branches equipped with a potential. The braid group action arises from monodromy of this potential. We show that in the case g=sl(2), this braid group action agrees with the braid group action constructed by Webster, which proves that Aganagic’s proposal gives a symplectic construction of Khovanov homology. This talk is based on 2505.00327 with Vivek Shende.
